# Python_Automation
The weakest link in security is often human behavior and poor password practices. This project automates the generation of strong, high-entropy passwords and supports their use with password managers to reduce credential reuse and weak password risks. It is designed as a simple, practical tool to help improve baseline security hygiene through automation.
